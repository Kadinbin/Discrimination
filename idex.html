<h2> Age Discrimination</h2>

<p> Our first project we did was about age discrimination. This biggest problem is people older than 40 are being disriminated against. They are either not being hired or being layed off. Even though in 1967 the ADEA was passed which was supposed to prevent older people being discriminated against in the work space. A poll showed that an astounding 80% of older worker had eperienced age discrimination while at work. Another way we could tell they are being discriminated against is by the simple fact that more younger people get hired in certain job fields regardless of experience.</p>
<p>  The reason for this discrimination is partly because of the deterioration of memory when you get to an older age. This leads to employers believing that it would be better to hire younger people as opposed to older ones. The discrimiation also has a large effect on how older people work. Reasearch shows that when the older people are exposed to negetive age steroetypes, they perform worse in physical/cognitive  </p>
